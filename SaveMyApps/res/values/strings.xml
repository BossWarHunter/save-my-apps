	<string name="help_dialog_text_1">
	    1- Choose a Google account to which synchronize your applications information 
	    (The apps info will be saved in a new task list called \"SaveMyAppsDefaultList\" 
	    in your account, you can later access this list on your browser by accessing 
	    to your GMail account).\n\n
	    2- Choose an app (or a group of them) by checking or un-checking the 
	    checkboxes on the right side.\n\n
	    3- Press the corresponding button (located on the top) to the action you 
	    want to perform on the chosen apps (\"Save Apps To Server\" or 
	    \"Remove Apps From Server\", when I say \"server\" I mean your GMail account, 
	    since that is where the apps information will be saved as mentioned earlier).\n\n
